# Seattle Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Problem Statement & Project Impact

### The Problem: Uncertainty in Local Weather Forecasting
Weather conditions play a critical role in transportation, energy usage, agriculture, and daily decision-making. Although weather forecasts are widely available, the underlying factors driving local weather patterns often remain unclear to developers, researchers, and data science learners. Without transparent, data-driven models, it is difficult to analyze trends or experiment with predictive techniques at a city level.

### The Solution: Data-Driven Weather Intelligence
This project develops a Machine Learning model to predict weather conditions in Seattle using historical meteorological data sourced from Kaggle. By learning patterns from features such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, the model transforms raw climate data into meaningful insights. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world environmental problems with measurable impact.


## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of daily weather observations for Seattle with the following features:

* **Date** – Daily timestamp of recorded observations  
* **Precipitation** – Amount of rainfall (mm)  
* **Maximum Temperature** – Highest temperature recorded per day  
* **Minimum Temperature** – Lowest temperature recorded per day  
* **Wind Speed** – Daily wind intensity  
* **Weather** – Weather condition label *(Target Variable)*  

This dataset provides a realistic foundation for supervised learning and climate-related analysis.


##  Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**


##  Key Insights from Analysis

* **Precipitation Influence** – Rainfall frequency is a defining characteristic of Seattle’s climate  
* **Temperature Patterns** – The interaction between minimum and maximum temperatures strongly impacts weather conditions  
* **Wind Contribution** – Wind speed improves prediction performance when combined with temperature features  
* **Seasonality** – The model captures recurring seasonal weather patterns across years  


##  Real-World Impact

* Supports urban planning and infrastructure preparedness  
* Assists transportation and logistics decision-making  
* Provides educational value for machine learning and data science learners  
* Demonstrates practical applications of environmental data analytics  


##  Future Improvements

* Experiment with advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
* Apply time-series forecasting techniques  
* Deploy the model as a web application or API  
* Integrate real-time weather data
